# Qualitaetsindex

Success in soccer is easily defined – the team that scores more goals than the opponent is victorious. This simplicity has it’s downsides. The better team is not always the more successful team. One key moment decides whether you are the winner or loser.
The question how successful a team is, measured by the course of the game, has no simple answer. Teams of analysts are searching for a plausible answer.
Several advanced metrics like expectedGoals or Packing made their way into the public. Those so called Key Performance Indicator should be the answer to question, which team was better. However there are many influencing factors, that determine the result of a match and because of this the two KPIs earn mixed reviews.
Nevertheless the search for a promising KPI continues. Dr. Stephan Nopp developed a KPI, that is tailored to the german nationalteam. It evaluates the offensive qualities of a team with advanced attacking prowess. The often used metrics like possession or running distance will not be considere. Therefore off the ball movement, quality of ball control and risk vs reward models for passing are the key features of the „Qualitätsindex“.
This scientific work focusses on the implementation, automation and qualitative analysis of the „Qualitätsindex“.
